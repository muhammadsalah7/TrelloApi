# Trello API Testing with Postman

This project features a comprehensive Postman collection that demonstrates key Trello API operations. The collection covers actions such as:

- **Creating and retrieving boards, lists, cards, and checklists**
- **Validating API responses** with tests for status codes, response times, and dynamic variable management
- **Demonstrating resource cleanup** by deleting created entities

It serves as a practical example of both manual and automated API testing using Postman, illustrating best practices in API interaction and response validation.
